hello.

my goals can be categorized by time horizon.  moreover, they are oriented towards the dual objective of developing as a coder and developing as an entrepreneur.

daily and weekly goals
	• write, edit, or review code every day
	• push to GitHub at least twice weekly, preferentially much more frequently than that

by July 31, 2016
	• deploy Peers and Rivals, a web app that provides users with information about how their pay relates to others // features of this app should be based on research and market feedback, not based merely upon what i think people want (perhaps i will use lessons taught by the Tech Entrepreneur Nanodegree program)

	• i am concurrently taking courses in data analytics using python.  i would like to apply this knowledge to develop player evaluation and performance prediction models for ice hockey

by December 31, 2016
	• prove that Peers and Rivals is business viable
	• publish to the web and/or via email newsletter hockey player and hockey team evaluations on a regular basis (bi-weekly or monthly)

**	while i am not actively seeking employment, getting a job as a coder
		would be potentially very good for me.  what that job is, where, and
		for whom, are totally obscure to me **
