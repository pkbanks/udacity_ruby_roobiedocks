challenges.

coding has never felt natural to me.

learning anything is a struggle.

in my experience, the best outcomes are achieved when i enjoy the struggle of the learning process.

i have failed two start-up attempts in the past.  mistakes were made and lessons were learned.  on my next attempt, i would like to achieve business feasibility from the start.
